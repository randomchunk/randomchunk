#-s should be 255, gets interpreted by script as 173 or something

#max size vs infilesize is a string comparison, not int. So 28 is evaluated as greater than 275

#min size isn't checked, so this won't error

#doesn't error if -s not specified and -r not specified
./randomchunk -i test/sowpods.txt -o out.txt -n 150 -x 200
#if we specify -r with no -n it will always give us "randomsize" == 0
